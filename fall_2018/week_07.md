## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I continued working with airflow. We had a good meeting with our mentor who graduated and discussed some future goals for the project.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I want to get airflow to work this week, but it is not a mission critical issue for our project with our presentation coming up in a few weeks. That being said, this week I'm going to try to assimilate into other subteams and see what we can accomplish moving towards the presentation deadline.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Nothing blocking.
