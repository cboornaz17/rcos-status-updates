## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I worked with my group to create a presentation and demo for our project. We needed to tie up a few loose ends with the frontend, but we got it all together in time for the demo during small group today.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

For this week, I'm going to keep working with my group on getting the presentation looking as good as possible, as well as thinking about our goals for next semester.

Over break I will spend some time reading up on the technologies we plan to use for back testing so we can hit the ground running when next semester starts.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Nothing blocking.
