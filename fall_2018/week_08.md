## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I worked with my group to discuss the current goals and directions
of our project. A group member made excellent progress on our REST API, so
we restructured our current plan of action moving forward.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

For this week, I'm going to keep working with my group on getting a demo ready
for our presentation. We need a few more things working to reach that goal,
so I plan on being a versatile team member this week and seeing whatever we
need to get done.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Nothing blocking.
