## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

Over the past week, I have been helping my teammates get set up on Docker. My
pull request from last week was merged, and that provided a basic working
Docker environment for the team. I am still learning about Docker-compose
and volumes, but I made some good progress on persisting the database this
week.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week, I will continue to work on docker-compose functionality. I want to
by the end of the week have the team all set up on Docker. From a group
perspective, we want to get some financial data into our postgres database
so that the rest of the teams can start doing work based on the sample data.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

It is important that we get some sample data into the database early on this
week so that the rest of the team is able to work off of this data.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
