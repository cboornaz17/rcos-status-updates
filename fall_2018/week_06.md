## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I worked on implementing airflow into our project. I started an
airflow web server on my vps, and am trying to configure it to run our data
pipeline.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Now that I have airflow running, I need to configure it to be a schedule for
our data pipeline. This involves creating/modifying config files and setting
up a database connection.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Nothing is blocking. In terms of the overarching goals of the project, we are waiting on the web application folks to have a functioning frontend before moving forward with more functionality.

## Notes
