## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I got started with pylint on the entire project. It is somewhat of a daunting task but we hope to get in done in the next couple weeks. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week, we'll continue linting and also work on improving the Docker infrastructure.

Our main goal on the Carme Core subteam is to improve core functionality/infrastructure, 
so I'm looking forward to making fixes in that area in the coming weeks as well.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

We are currently not blocked.

## Notes
