## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I continued using pylint on our codebase. We still have a lot to do but are making good progress.

This week for Hedgehogs I studied up on Docker Compose and PostgreSQL, and began drafting solutions to
adapt the infrastructure to Docker.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week, I will continue/hopefully finish linting Carme, looking into the git modules for python, and looking
at implementing a simple Docker Compose file into Hedgehogs

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I am currently not blocked. As the Hedgehogs team makes more progress with their application, I will be able to do
more and more with Docker.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
