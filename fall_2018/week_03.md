## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week was actually two weeks, we missed last week's meeting due to a holiday.

Over the past two weeks, I have shifted my focus to the Hedgehogs Project. I have been working on getting docker-compose working for this project, and I submitted a pull request today that should hopefully help the other members of the group develop their features.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week, I will continue to work on docker-compose functionality. As it stands, the docker version can start postgres and enter a python environment. In the next couple weeks, I hope to get it to run python files automatically to download, parse, and put stock data into the postgres database.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

After submitting my pull request today, I am waiting on my fellow group members who are working on python functionality to download and parse stock data.

## Notes
